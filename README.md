We all like to travel, and probably all of us have experienced being in a
station waiting for a connection for hours not knowing what to do.
What if that time could turn into a great opportunity to be seized?

Show-meAround is a platform designed to meet the needs of both travelers
and local communities. Through this app, residents can offer
their very own guided tours to those who face long and tedious waits.

The idea for this Beta version came from APS Creative 108's SOJUEN project. A course
of design thinking as part of which the municipality of Bologna provided a group of young
social innovators concrete problem areas to analyze. After a phase of empathising, i.e., reaching out
directly with the people involved to understand their real needs, the group designed the platform that
I had the pleasure of implementing.

### Built With

Show-meAround was created by using the following awesome tools:

Frontend:<br/>

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

Backend:<br/>

- [Node / Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

Authentication and Image Storage:

## Run locally

### Backend

Navigate to the server folder and run the following commands

```bash
npm install
```

```bash

```

### Frontend

```bash

Now you should have frontend and backend up and running!
